This desktop app was created as a solo project for a class in my final semester of college. While I may continue working with this app, all future changes will be on a separate repository.

This project was my first experience with APIs of any kind. It was also the first time I really tried to dig into WinForms to create a very custom UI(I hadn't heard of WPF yet). When looking at the app's code, please keep in mind that it is still in a very rough state and I have since improved substantially. 

This VaultBuddy is very different from the mobile app version but it was a necessary step in VaultBuddyMobile's development. In this desktop version, the user can search a player's display name and view all of their characters and items, similar to the search view in VBMobile. I had innitially planned to create this desktop app to perform all of the same tasks as the mobile app currently does but ran out of time, resulting in the decision to create VaultBuddyMobile.
